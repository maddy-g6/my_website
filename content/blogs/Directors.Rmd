[IMDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. Utilising IMDB data, I want to determe whether Steven Spielberg or Tim Burton has a higher mean rating. To do this, I have constructed visualisations and ran a hypothesis test.

------------------

```{r, load-movies-data, echo = FALSE}

movies <- read_csv("movies.csv")

```
First, we constructed a table of summary statistics as well as boxplots of both directors mean ratings to gain a better understanding of our dataset.

```{r,  out.width="100%", echo = FALSE}

directors_ci <- movies %>%
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_rating = sd(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n(),
            
             #get t-crit value with (n-1) degress of freedom
            
            t_crit = qt(.975, count-1),
            se = sd_rating/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_crit*se,
            ci_low = mean_rating - margin_of_error,
            ci_high = mean_rating + margin_of_error)

directors_ci %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  kable_material(c("striped", "hover"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(directors_ci,
       aes(y = reorder(director, mean_rating),
           x = mean_rating,
           colour = director)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_errorbar(width = .1, aes(xmin = ci_low, xmax = ci_high), lwd = 1.75) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(mean_rating,2)),hjust=0.5, vjust=-2,
            size=5) +
  labs(x = "Mean IMDB Rating",
       y = " ",
       title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB rating?",
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap") +
  theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = "bold") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_rect(mapping = aes(xmin = 7.27, 
                          xmax = 7.33, 
                          ymin = 0, 
                          ymax = 3), 
            colour = "gray", 
            alpha= 0.2) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


```

--------------------------------------------

To test for a difference in the means, I used a t-test with the following hypotheses: 

* Ho: The mean rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is the same
* H1: The mean rating is not the same

```{r, echo = FALSE}

directors <- movies %>%
 filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director=="Tim Burton")

t.test(rating ~ director, data = directors)

```
The t-test resulted with a t-statistic of 3 and a p-value of .01, meaning that we reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is statistically significant evidence that Steven Spielberg has a higher mean rating than Tim Burton.
